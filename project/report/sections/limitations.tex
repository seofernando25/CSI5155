\section{Limitations}

This study relies on the CIFAR-10 dataset and a synthetic uniform label noise model. To exclude artifacts of low-resolution data or synthetic randomization, future work should validate these findings on high-dimensional datasets like ImageNet \cite{krizhevsky2012imagenet} and naturally occurring label noise distributions (instead of a synthetic uniform label noise model). This is necessary to confirm if the scaling laws proposed by Nakkiran et al. \cite{nakkiran2019deep} hold across diverse data modalities.


Furthermore, this experiment utilized a standard CNN. Because model biases affect generalization \cite{belkin2019reconciling}, future studies would have to repeat this scaling study on other architecture (e.g., ResNets, Transformers) to see if model size behaves differently as more depth or attention layers are added, as hinted by Zhang et al. \cite{zhang2017understanding}.
