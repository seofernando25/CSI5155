\section{Limitations}

This study is constrained by several factors. First, the analysis is limited to a single CNN architecture family and one dataset, CIFAR-10. While the 20\% label noise successfully induced the phenomenon, this effect may vary with different noise models or datasets. Finally, the Fisher Vector baseline, while strong, is one of many classical techniques; other handcrafted features might yield different baseline results.
